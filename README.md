# OptimizelySDKWrapper-iOS


 
 

This is a wrapper of the Optimizely iOS SDK written entirely in swift. The wrapper makes SDK usage even easier. We also created new functions which some of our previous clients have needed to make the onboarding of the SDK that much easier.

After installing SDK downloads these files and add them to your swift app. 

There are a few things you need to change to get started: 

In the “OptimizelyService” file change the ‘jsonDatafile’ variable to point to your datafile. Your link is available in the Optimizely dashboard under Settings. 

Also in the “OptimizelyService” file change the “sdkKey” to your SDK key which is also found in the Optimizely dashboard under the Settings
